# What is Mapnik?

Mapnik is an open source toolkit and API for developing mapping applications. At the core is a C++ shared library providing algorithms and patterns for spatial data access and visualization. High-level bindings for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby facilitate rapid application development in a variety of environments.

# Overview

Mapnik is basically a collection of geographic objects like maps, layers, datasources, features, and geometries. The library doesn't rely on any OS specific "windowing systems" and it can be deployed to any server environment. It is intended to play fair in a multi-threaded environment and is aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at web-based development.
