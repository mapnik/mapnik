## 2.3.0

Released ...

(Packaged from ...)

Summary: TODO

- PostGIS: Added support for rendering 3D and 4D geometries (previously silently skipped) (#44)

- AGG renderer: fixed geometry offsetting to work after smoothing to produce more consistent results (#2202)

- AGG renderer: increased `vertex_dist_epsilon` to ensure nearly coincident points are discarded more readily (#2196)

- GDAL plugin: Added back support for user driven `nodata` on rgb(a) images (#2023)

- GDAL plugin: Allowed nodata to override alpha band if set on rgba images (#2023)

- GDAL plugin: Added `nodata_tolerance` option to set nearby pixels transparent (has similar effect to the `nearblack` program) (#2023)

- Added support for web fonts: .woff format (#2113)

- Added missing support for `geometry-transform` in `line-pattern` and `polygon-pattern` symbolizers (#2065)

- Upgraded unifont to `unifont-6.3.20131020`

- CSV Plugin: added the ability to pass an `extent` in options

- Fixed crash when rendering to cairo context from python (#2031)

- Moved `label-position-tolerance` from unsigned type to double

- Added support for more seamless blurring by rendering to a larger internal image to avoid edge effects (#1478)

- Fixed rendering of large shapes at high zoom levels, which might dissapear due to integer overflow. This
  bug was previously fixable when geometries were clipped, but would, until now, re-appear if clipping was turned
  off for a symbolizer (#2000)

- Added single color argument support to `colorize-alpha` to allow colorizing alpha with one color.

- Added `color-to-alpha` `image-filter` to allow for applying alpha in proportion to color similiarity (#2023)

- Added Async support to PostGIS plugin - https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/PostGIS-Async

- Fixed alpha handling bug with `comp-op:dst-over` (#1995)

- Fixed alpha handling bug with building-fill-opacity (#2011)

- Optimized mapnik.Path.to_wkb

- Python: added `__geo_interface__` to mapnik.Feature and mapnik.Path (#2009)

- Python: Exposed optimized WKTReader for parsing WKT into geometry paths (6bfbb53)

- Optimized expression evaluation of text by avoiding extra copy (1dd1275)

- Added Map level `background-image-comp-op` to control the compositing operation used to blend the 
`background-image` onto the `background-color`. Has no meaning if `background-color` or `background-image`
are not set. (#1966)

- Added Map level `background-image-opacity` to dynamically set the opacity of the `background-image` (#1966)

- Removed `RENDERING_STATS` compile option since it should be replaced with a better solution (#1956)

- Added support to experimental `svg_renderer` for grouping layers for inkscape and illustrator (#1917)

- Fixed compile of python bindings against Python 3.x

- Optimized SVG loading by improving color parsing speed (#1918)

- Fixed startup problem when fonts cannot be read due to lacking permissions (#1919)

- Fixed bad behavior when negative image dimensions are requested (#1927)

- Fixed handling of `marker-ignore-placement:true` when `marker-placement:line` (#1931)

- Fixed handling of svg `opacity` in Cairo renderer (#1943)

- Fixed handling of SVG files which contain empty `<g>` (#1944)

- Fixed various 32bit test failures

- Fixed compile against icu when by using `U_NAMESPACE_QUALIFIER`

- Fixed missing support for using PathExpression in `marker-file` (#1952)

- Added support for building on Android (tested with `android-ndk-r9`)

- Added support for compiling with both -ansi (aka -std=c++98) and -std=c++11

- Added support for compiling and linking on OS X against libc++

- Fixed regression in handling `F` type dbf fields, introduced in v2.2.0.

- Added the ability to create a mapnik Feature from a geojson feature with `mapnik.Feature.from_geojson` in python.

- Added to python bindings: `has_tiff`, `has_png`, `has_webp`, `has_proj4`, `has_svg_renderer`, and `has_grid_renderer`

- Made it possible to disable compilation of `grid_renderer` with `./configure GRID_RENDERER=False` (#1962)

- Added `premultiplied` property on mapnik::image_32 / mapnik.Image to enable knowledge of premultiplied status of image buffer.

- Added `webp` image encoding and decoding support (#1955)

- Added `scale-hsla` image-filter that allows scaling colors in HSL color space. RGB is converted to HSL (hue-saturation-lightness) and then each value (and the original alpha value) is stretched based on the specified scaling values. An example syntax is `scale-hsla(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)` which means no change because the full range will be kept (0 for lowest, 1 for highest). Other examples are: 1) `scale-hsla(0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1)` which would force all colors to be red in hue in the same way `scale-hsla(1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)` would, 2) `scale-hsla(0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1)` which would cause all colors to become fully saturated, 3) `scale-hsla(0,1,1,1,0,1,.5,1)` which would force no colors to be any more transparent than half, and 4) `scale-hsla(0,1,1,1,0,1,0,.5)` which would force all colors to be at least half transparent. (#1954)

## 2.2.0

Released June 3rd, 2013

(Packaged from 9231205)

Summary: The 2.2.0 release is primarily a performance and stability release. The code line represents development in the master branch since the release of 2.1.0 in Aug 2012 and therefore includes nearly a year of bug-fixes and optimizations. Nearly 500 new tests have been added bring the total coverage to 925. Shapefile and PostGIS datasources have benefited from numerous stability fixes, 64 bit integer support has been added to support OSM data in the grid renderer and in attribute filtering, and many fixes have landed for higher quality output when using a custom `scale_factor` during rendering. Critical code paths have been optimized include raster rendering, xml map loading, string to number conversion, vector reprojection when using `epsg:4326` and `epsg:3857`, `hextree` encoding, halo rendering, and rendering when using a custom `gamma`. Mapnik 2.2 also compiles faster than previous releases in the 2.x series and drops several unneeded and hard to install dependencies making builds on OS X and Windows easier than any previous release.

- Removed 3 depedencies without loosing any functionality: `ltdl`, `cairomm` and `libsigc++` (#1804,#806,#1681)

- Added 64 bit integer support in expressions, feature ids, and the grid_renderer (#1661,#1662,#1662)

- Added the ability to disable the need for various dependencies: `proj4`, `libpng`, `libtiff`, `libjpeg`

- Added faster reprojection support between `epsg:3857` and `epsg:4326` (#1705,#1703,#1579)

- Added `colorize-alpha` image filter that applies user provided color gradients based on level of alpha.
  Accepts one or more colors separated by commas. Each color can be paired with an `offset` value separated
  by a space that is either `0-100%` or `0.0-1.0`. An `offset` of `0` is implied and the default. For background
  on where this design came from see http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#GradientStops. A simple example
  of colorizing alpha into a "rainbow" is `colorize-alpha(blue,cyan,lightgreen, yellow, orange, red)`. An example of
  using offsets and the variety of supported color encodings is to produce a ramp which sharp contrast between `blue`
  and `cyan` is `colorize-alpha(blue 30%, cyan, yellow 0.7 , rgb(0%,80%,0%) 90%)` (#1371).

- Fixed concurrency problem when using cursors in postgis plugin (#1823,#1588)

- Fixed postgres connection pool leaks when using `persist_connection=false` (#1764)

- Added detection of invalid srs values when loading xml (#646)

- Added support for specifying a base_path as a third, optional argument to load_xml

- Removed muffling of projection errors while rendering (#646)

- Improved logging system (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/Logging)

- Added support for reading images from in memory streams (#1805)

- Optimized halo rendering. When halo radius is < 1 new method will be used automatically (#1781)

- Added `text-halo-rasterizer` property. Set to `fast` for lower quality but faster
  halo rendering (#1298) which matched new default method when radius is < 1.

- Added support in `shape`, `sqlite`, `geojson`, and `csv` plugin for handling non-latin characters in the paths to file-based resources (#1177)

- Fixed rendering of markers when their size is greater than the specified `spacing` value (#1487)

- Fixed handling of alpha premultiplication in image scaling (#1489)

- Optimized rendering when a style with no symbolizers is encountered (#1517)

- Optimized string handling and type conversion by removing `boost::to_lower`, `boost::trim`, and `boost::lexical_cast` usage (#1687,#1687,#1633)

- Removed internal rule cache on `mapnik::Map` c++ object (#1723)

- Improved the scaled rendering of various map features when using `scale_factor` > 1 (#1280,#1100,#1273,#1792,#1291,#1344,#1279,#1624,#1767,#1766)

- Added C++ api for overriding scale_denominator to enable rendering at fixed scale (#1582)

- Added Layer `buffer-size` that can be used to override Map `buffer-size` to avoid
  over-fetching of data that does not need to be buffered as much as other layers.
  Map level `buffer-size` will be default if layers do not set the option. Renamed a
  previously undocumented parameter by the same name that impacted clipping extent and
  was not needed (clipping padding should likely be a symbolizer level option) (#1566)

- Fixed potential file descriptor leaks in image readers when invalid images were encountered (#1783)

- Added support for DBF `Logical` type: #1614

- Added serialization of `line-offset` to save_map (#1562)

- Enabled default input plugin directory and fonts path to be set inherited from environment settings in

    - MAPNIK_FONT_DIRECTORY

- Added support for controlling rendering behavior of markers on multi-geometries `marker-multi-policy` (#1555,#1573)

- Added alternative PNG/ZLIB implementation (`miniz`) that can be enabled with `e=miniz` (#1554)

- Added support for setting zlib `Z_FIXED` strategy with format string: `png:z=fixed`

- Fixed handling of transparency level option in `octree` png encoding (#1556)

- Added ability to pass a pre-created collision detector to the cairo renderer (#1444)

- Allow style level compositing operations to work outside of featureset extents across tiled requests (#1477)

- Support for encoding `literal` postgres types as strings 69fb17cd3/#1466

- Fixed zoom_all behavior when Map maximum-extent is provided. Previously maximum-extent was used outright but
  now the combined layer extents will be again respected: they will be clipped to the maximum-extent if possible
  and only when back-projecting fails for all layers will the maximum-extent be used as a fallback (#1473)

Released Aug 3, 2012

(Packaged from adb2ec741)

- Fixed handling of empty WKB geometries (#1334)

- Fixed ShieldSymbolizer placement so it respects avoid-edges and minimum-padding across all renderers (#1242)

- Rolled back change made in 2.0.1 to marker width/height meaning that Mapnik > 2.0.2 will stick to assuming width/heigh are radii for back compatibility with 2.0.0. The reverted change is seen below as "Fix Markers rendering so that ellipse height/width units are pixels (previously were unintentionally radii)". Issue tracking this is #1163

- XML: Fixed to avoid throwing if a `<Parameters>` element is encountered (which is supported in >= 2.1.x)

- Support for PostGIS 2.0 in the pgsql2sqlite command (e69c44e/47e5b3c)

- Fixed reference counting of Py_None when returning null attributes from Postgres during UTFGrid encoding, which could cause a Fatal Python error: deallocating None (#1221)

- Fixed possible breakage registering plugins via python if a custom PREFIX or DESTDIR was used (e.g. macports/homebrew) (#1171)

- Fixed memory leak in the case of proj >= 4.8 and a projection initialization error (#1173)


## Mapnik 2.0.1

(Packaged from 57347e9106)

- Support for PostGIS 2.0 (#956,#1083)

- Fixed `mapnik-config --version` (#903)

- Cairo: Add full rendering support for markers to match AGG renderer functionality (#1071)

## Mapnik 2.0.0

Released September 26, 2011

(Packaged from 5b4c20eab3)

- Add minimum-path-length property to text_symbolizer to allow labels to be placed only on lines of a certain length (#865)

- Add support for png quantization using fixed palettes (#843)

- Add AlsoFilter functionality - https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/AlsoFilter

- SQLite Plugin: optimize i/o using shared cache and no mutexes (#797)

- Directly link input plugins to libmapnik to avoid having to set dlopen flags from binding languages (#790)

- Throw an error during registration for fonts which Freetype2 does not report a family or style name (r2985).

- Fixed quoting syntax for "table"."attribute" in PostGIS plugin (previously if table aliases were used quoting like "table.attribute" would cause query failure) (r2979).

- Added the ability to control the PostGIS feature id by suppling a key_field to reference and integer attribute name (r2979).

- Added alternative, more robust proj_transform functions to project a bbox using more points than just the four
  corners to ensure an optimally sized bbox despite proj4 out of bounds conditions. (olt)

- Added map.base parameter that can be set to control where files with relative paths should be interpreted
  from when a map is loaded from a string or saved to a string. It defaults to an empty string which means
  that the base path will be the current working directory of the mapnik process. When a stylesheet is read
  from a file that files directory is used. And a custom value can still be passed as an argument to
  load_map_from_string().

- Added python function `render_grid` to allow conversion of grid buffer to python object containing list of grid
  pixels, list of keys, and a and dictionary of feature attributes.

- Added new rendering backend, grid_renderer, that collects the attributes of rendered features and
  burns their ids into a grid buffer.

- Added optional `maximum-extent` parameter to map object. If set will be used, instead of combined
  layer extents, for return value of map.zoom_all(). Useful in cases where the combined layer extents
  cannot possibly be projected into the map srs or the user wishes to control map bounds without
  modifying the extents of each layer.

- Shapefile Plugin: Throw error if attribute name is requested that does not exist (#604)

- Upgraded to the latest proj4 string literal for EPSG:4326 (WGS84) as global default projection (#333)

- Added `mapnik_version_from_string()` function in python bindings to easily convert string representation
  of version number to the integer format used in `mapnik/version.hpp`. e.g. `0.7.1` --> `701`.

- Added xinclude (http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) support to libxml2-based xml parser (oldtopos) (#567)

- Optimized rendering speeds by avoiding locking in the projection code (r2063) (r2713)

- Fixed reading of PostGIS data on Big Endian systems (#515)

- PostGIS: Added better support for alternative schemas (#500)

- AGG Renderer - Enforced default gamma function on all symbolizers to ensure proper antialiasing

- SCons: Added new build options `PRIORITIZE_LINKING` and `LINK_PRIORITY`. The first is a boolean (default True)
  of whether to use the new sorting implementation that gives explcit preference to custom or local paths
  during compile and linking that will affect builds when duplicate libraries and include directories are on the
  system. LINK_PRIORITY defaults to prioritizing internal sources of the mapnik source folder, then local/user
  installed libraries over system libraries, but the option can be customized. Sorting not only ensures that
  compiling and linking will more likely match the desired libraries but also gives more likelyhood to avoid
  the scenario where libraries are linked that don`t match the includes libmapnik compiled against.

- XML: Fixed behavior of PolygonPatternSymbolizer and LinePatternSymbolizer whereby width, height,
  and type of images is actually allowed to be optionally ommitted ([#508](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/508)). This was added in r1543 but
  only worked correctly for PointSymbolizer and ShieldSymbolizer.

- Fixed reading of PostGIS data on Big Endian systems ([#515](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/515))

- PostGIS: Added better support for alterative schemas ([#500](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/500))

- AGG Renderer - Enforced default gamma function on all symbolizers to ensure proper antialiasing
  even when gamma is modified on the PolygonSymbolizer. ([#512](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/512))

- PNG: fixed png256 for large images and some improvements to reduce color corruptions ([#522](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/522))

- PNG: Added new quantization method for indexed png format using `hextree` with full support for alpha
  channel. Also new method has some optimizations for color gradients common when using elevation based
  rasters. By default old method using `octree` is used. (r1680, r1683, [#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477))

- PNG: Added initial support for passing options to png writter like number of colors, transparency
  support, quantization method and possibly other in future using type parameter. For example
  "png8:c=128:t=1:m=h" limits palette to 128 colors, uses only binary transparency (0 - none,
  1 - binary, 2 - full), and new method of quantization using `hextree` (h - `hextree`, o - `octree`).
  Existing type "png256" can be also written using "png8:c=256:m=o:t=2"  (r1680, r1683, [#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477))


# Mapnik 0.7.0

Released January, 19 2010

(Packaged from r1574/a0da946be9)

- Core: Fixed linking to external libagg (r1297,r1299)

- Core: Completed full support for PPC (Big endian) architectures (r1352 -> r1357)

- Gdal Plugin: Added support for Gdal overviews, enabling fast loading of > 1GB rasters (#54)

    * Use the gdaladdo utility to add overviews to existing GDAL datasets

- PostGIS: Added an optional `geometry_table` parameter. The `geometry_table` used by Mapnik to look up
  metadata in the geometry_columns and calculate extents (when the `geometry_field` and `srid` parameters
  are not supplied). If `geometry_table` is not specified Mapnik will attempt to determine the name of the
  table to query based on parsing the `table` parameter, which may fail for complex queries with more than
  one `from` keyword. Using this parameter should allow for existing metadata and table indexes to be used
  while opening the door to much more complicated subqueries being passed to the `table` parameter without
  failing (#260, #426).

- PostGIS Plugin: Added optional `geometry_field` and `srid` parameters. If specified these will allow
  Mapnik to skip several queries to try to determine these values dynamically, and can be helpful to avoid
  possible query failures during metadata lookup with complex subqueries as discussed in #260 and #436, but
  also solvable by specifying the `geometry_table` parameter. (r1300,#376)

- PostGIS: Added an optional `extent_from_subquery` parameter that when true (while the `extent` parameter is
  not provided and `estimate_extent` is false) will direct Mapnik to calculate the extent upon the exact table
  or sql provided in the `table` parameter. If a sub-select is used for the table parameter then this will,
  in cases where the subquery limits results, provide a faster and more accurate layer extent. It will have
  no effect if the `table` parameter is simply an existing table. This parameter is false by default. (#456)

- PostGIS Plugin: Added `!bbox!` token substitution ability in sql query string. This opens the door for various
  complex queries that may aggregate geometries to be kept fast by allowing proper placement of the bbox
  query to be used by indexes. (#415)

    * Pass the bbox token inside a subquery like: !bbox!

    * Valid Usages include:

        <Parameter name="table">
          (Select ST_Union(geom) as geom from table where ST_Intersects(geometry,!bbox!)) as map
        </Parameter>

        <Parameter name="table">
          (Select * from table where geom &amp;&amp; !bbox!) as map
        </Parameter>

- PostGIS Plugin: Added `scale_denominator` substitution ability in sql query string (#415/#465)

    * Pass the scale_denominator token inside a subquery like: !scale_denominator!

    * e.g. (Select * from table where field_value > !scale_denominator!) as map

- PostGIS Plugin: Added support for quoted table names (r1454) (#393)

- PostGIS: Add a `persist_connection` option (default true), that when false will release
  the idle psql connection after datasource goes out of scope (r1337) (#433,#434)

- PNG: Fixed problem with garbled/striped png256 output along sharp edges(#416,#445,#447,#202)

- PNG: Added support for semi-transparency in png256 output (#477,#202)

- PolygonSymbolizer: Added `gamma` attribute to allow for dilation of polygon edges - a solution
  to gap artifacts or "ghost lines" between adjacent polygons and allows for slight sharpening of
  the edges of non overlapping polygons. Accepts any values but 0-1 is the recommended range.

- TextSymbolizer: Large set of new attributes: `text_transform`, `line_spacing`, `character_spacing`,
  `wrap_character`, `wrap_before`, `horizontal_alignment`, `justify_alignment`, and `opacity`.

    * More details at changesets: r1254 and r1341

- SheildSymbolizer: Added special new attributes: `unlock_image`, `VERTEX` placement, `no_text` and many
  attributes previously only supported in the TextSymbolizer: `allow_overlap`, `vertical_alignment`,
  `horizontal_alignment`, `justify_alignment`, `wrap_width`, `wrap_character`, `wrap_before`, `text_transform`,
  `line_spacing`, `character_spacing`, and `opacity`.

    * More details at changeset r1341
