Developers: Please commit along with changes.

For a complete change history, see the git log.


## Mapnik 2.1.0

Not yet released

- Added style-level 'opacity' (#314)

- PostGIS: Added 'simplify_geometries' option - will trigger ST_Simplify on geometries before returning to Mapnik (#1179)

- Improved error feedback for invalid values passed to map.query_point

- Fixed rendering of thin svg lines (#1129)

- Improved logging/debugging system with release logs and file redirection (#937 and partially #986, #467)

- GDAL: allow setting nodata value on the fly (will override value if nodata is set in data) (#1161)
 
- GDAL: respect nodata for paletted/colormapped images (#1160)

- PostGIS: Added a new option called 'autodetect_key_field' (by default false) that if true will
  trigger autodetection of a given tables' primary key allowing for feature.id() to represent
  globally unique ids. This option has no effect if the user has not manually supplied the 'key_field' option. (#804)

- Cairo: Add full rendering support for markers to match AGG renderer functionality (#1071)

- Fix Markers rendering so that ellipse height/width units are pixels (previously were unintentionally radii) (#1134)

- Added 'ignore-placement` attribute to markers-symbolizer (#1135)

- Removed PointDatasource - use more robust MemoryDatasource instead (#1032)

- SQLite - Added support for !intersects! token in sql subselects (#809) allow custom positioning of rtree spatial filter.

- New CSV plugin - reads tabular files - autodetecting geo columns, newlines, and delimiters. Uses in-memory featureset for fast rendering and is not designed for large files (#902)

- Fixed bug in shield line placement when dx/dy are used to shift the label relative to the placement point (Matt Amos) (#908)

- Added <layer_by_sql> parameter in OGR plugin to select a layer by SQL query (besides name or index): see http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_sql.html for specifications (kunitoki) (#472)

- Added support for output maps as tiff files (addresses #967 partially)

- Added support for justify-alignment=auto. This is the new default. (#1125)

(Packaged from 57347e9106)

- Support for PostGIS 2.0 (#956,#1083)

- Switched back to "libmapnik" and "import mapnik" rather than "mapnik2" (mapnik2 will still work from python) (#941)

## Mapnik 2.0.0

Released September 26, 2011

(Packaged from 5b4c20eab3)

- Add minimum-path-length property to text_symbolizer to allow labels to be placed only on lines of a certain length (#865)

- Add support for png quantization using fixed palettes (#843)

- Add AlsoFilter functionality - http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/AlsoFilter

- SQLite Plugin: optimize i/o using shared cache and no mutexes (#797)

- Directly link input plugins to libmapnik to avoid having to set dlopen flags from binding languages (#790)

- Throw an error during registration for fonts which Freetype2 does not report a family or style name (r2985).

- Fixed quoting syntax for "table"."attribute" in PostGIS plugin (previously if table aliases were used quoting like "table.attribute" would cause query failure) (r2979).

- Added the ability to control the PostGIS feature id by suppling a key_field to reference and integer attribute name (r2979).

- Added alternative, more robust proj_transform functions to project a bbox using more points than just the four
  corners to ensure an optimally sized bbox despite proj4 out of bounds conditions. (olt)

- Added map.base parameter that can be set to control where files with relative paths should be interpreted
  from when a map is loaded from a string or saved to a string. It defaults to an empty string which means
  that the base path will be the current working directory of the mapnik process. When a stylesheet is read
  from a file that files directory is used. And a custom value can still be passed as an argument to
  load_map_from_string().

- Added python function 'render_grid' to allow conversion of grid buffer to python object containing list of grid
  pixels, list of keys, and a and dictionary of feature attributes.

- Added new rendering backend, grid_renderer, that collects the attributes of rendered features and
  burns their ids into a grid buffer.

- Added optional 'maximum-extent' parameter to map object. If set will be used, instead of combined
  layer extents, for return value of map.zoom_all(). Useful in cases where the combined layer extents
  cannot possibly be projected into the map srs or the user wishes to control map bounds without
  modifying the extents of each layer.

- Support for NODATA values with grey and rgb images in GDAL plugin (#727)

- Print warning if invalid XML property names are used (#110)

- Made XML property names use consistent dashes, never underscores (#644)

- Added support for drawing only first matching rule using filter-mode="first" in Style (#706)

- Added support to PointSymbolizer ('ignore_placement') for skipping adding placed points to collision detector (#564)

- Added ability to register fonts within XML using Map level 'font_directory' parameter (#168)

- TextSymbolizer: Change text_convert to text_transform to better match css naming (r2211)

- Shapefile Plugin: Throw error if attribute name is requested that does not exist (#604)

- Upgraded to the latest proj4 string literal for EPSG:4326 (WGS84) as global default projection (#333)

- Added 'mapnik_version_from_string()' function in python bindings to easily convert string representation
  of version number to the integer format used in 'mapnik/version.hpp'. e.g. '0.7.1' --> 701.

- Added xinclude (http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) support to libxml2-based xml parser (oldtopos) (#567)

- Optimized rendering speeds by avoiding locking in the projection code (r2063) (r2713)

- Added support for setting global alignment of polygon pattern fills (#203)

- Added support for choosing OGR layer by index number using 'layer_by_index' parameter (r1904)

- Added support for fractional halo widths (using FT Stroker) (#93)

- Added support for reading jpeg images (in addition to png/tiff) for image symbolizers (#518)

- Fixed reading of PostGIS data on Big Endian systems (#515)

- PostGIS: Added better support for alternative schemas (#500)

- AGG Renderer - Enforced default gamma function on all symbolizers to ensure proper antialiasing
  even when gamma is modified on the PolygonSymbolizer. (#512)

- Added ability to read pre 2.0.0 stylesheets, but prints a warning for deprecated syntax (r1592, #501)

- Rasterlite Plugin: Experimental support for Rasterlite, to practically use sqlite database with wavelet compressed rasters (#469)

# Mapnik 0.7.1

Released March 23, 2010

(Packaged from r1745/db89f1ca75)

- Rasters: Various fixes and improvements to 8bit png output ([#522](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/522),[#475](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/475))

- XML: Save map buffer_size when serializing map.

- SCons: Added new build options 'PRIORITIZE_LINKING' and 'LINK_PRIORITY'. The first is a boolean (default True)
  of whether to use the new sorting implementation that gives explcit preference to custom or local paths
  during compile and linking that will affect builds when duplicate libraries and include directories are on the
  system. LINK_PRIORITY defaults to prioritizing internal sources of the mapnik source folder, then local/user
  installed libraries over system libraries, but the option can be customized. Sorting not only ensures that
  compiling and linking will more likely match the desired libraries but also gives more likelyhood to avoid
  the scenario where libraries are linked that don't match the includes libmapnik compiled against.

- XML: Fixed behavior of PolygonPatternSymbolizer and LinePatternSymbolizer whereby width, height,
  and type of images is actually allowed to be optionally ommitted ([#508](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/508)). This was added in r1543 but
  only worked correctly for PointSymbolizer and ShieldSymbolizer.

- Fixed reading of PostGIS data on Big Endian systems ([#515](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/515))

- PostGIS: Added better support for alterative schemas ([#500](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/500))

- AGG Renderer - Enforced default gamma function on all symbolizers to ensure proper antialiasing
  even when gamma is modified on the PolygonSymbolizer. ([#512](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/512))

- PNG: fixed png256 for large images and some improvements to reduce color corruptions ([#522](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/522))

- PNG: Added new quantization method for indexed png format using hextree with full support for alpha
  channel. Also new method has some optimizations for color gradients common when using elevation based
  rasters. By default old method using octree is used. (r1680, r1683, [#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477))

- PNG: Added initial support for passing options to png writter like number of colors, transparency
  support, quantization method and possibly other in future using type parameter. For example
  "png8:c=128:t=1:m=h" limits palette to 128 colors, uses only binary transparency (0 - none,
  1 - binary, 2 - full), and new method of quantization using hextree (h - hextree, o - octree).
  Existing type "png256" can be also written using "png8:c=256:m=o:t=2"  (r1680, r1683, [#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477))


# Mapnik 0.7.0

Released January, 19 2010

(Packaged from r1574/a0da946be9)

- Core: Fixed linking to external libagg (r1297,r1299)

- Core: Completed full support for PPC (Big endian) architectures (r1352 -> r1357)

- Gdal Plugin: Added support for Gdal overviews, enabling fast loading of > 1GB rasters (#54)

    * Use the gdaladdo utility to add overviews to existing GDAL datasets

- PostGIS: Added an optional 'geometry_table' parameter. The 'geometry_table' used by Mapnik to look up
  metadata in the geometry_columns and calculate extents (when the 'geometry_field' and 'srid' parameters
  are not supplied). If 'geometry_table' is not specified Mapnik will attempt to determine the name of the
  table to query based on parsing the 'table' parameter, which may fail for complex queries with more than
  one 'from' keyword. Using this parameter should allow for existing metadata and table indexes to be used
  while opening the door to much more complicated subqueries being passed to the 'table' parameter without
  failing (#260, #426).

- PostGIS Plugin: Added optional 'geometry_field' and 'srid' parameters. If specified these will allow
  Mapnik to skip several queries to try to determine these values dynamically, and can be helpful to avoid
  possible query failures during metadata lookup with complex subqueries as discussed in #260 and #436, but
  also solvable by specifying the 'geometry_table' parameter. (r1300,#376)

- PostGIS: Added an optional 'extent_from_subquery' parameter that when true (while the 'extent' parameter is
  not provided and 'estimate_extent' is false) will direct Mapnik to calculate the extent upon the exact table
  or sql provided in the 'table' parameter. If a sub-select is used for the table parameter then this will,
  in cases where the subquery limits results, provide a faster and more accurate layer extent. It will have
  no effect if the 'table' parameter is simply an existing table. This parameter is false by default. (#456)

- PostGIS Plugin: Added '!bbox!' token substitution ability in sql query string. This opens the door for various
  complex queries that may aggregate geometries to be kept fast by allowing proper placement of the bbox
  query to be used by indexes. (#415)

    * Pass the bbox token inside a subquery like: !bbox!

    * Valid Usages include:

        <Parameter name="table">
          (Select ST_Union(geom) as geom from table where ST_Intersects(geometry,!bbox!)) as map
        </Parameter>

        <Parameter name="table">
          (Select * from table where geom &amp;&amp; !bbox!) as map
        </Parameter>

- PostGIS Plugin: Added 'scale_denominator' substitution ability in sql query string (#415/#465)

    * Pass the scale_denominator token inside a subquery like: !scale_denominator!

    * e.g. (Select * from table where field_value > !scale_denominator!) as map

- PostGIS Plugin: Added support for quoted table names (r1454) (#393)

- PostGIS: Add a 'persist_connection' option (default true), that when false will release
  the idle psql connection after datasource goes out of scope (r1337) (#433,#434)

- PostGIS: Added support for BigInt (int8) postgres type (384)

- PostGIS Plugin: Throw and report errors if SQL execution fails (r1291) (#363, #242)

- PostGIS Plugin: Fixed problem in conversion of long numbers to strings (r1302,1303)

- PostGIS Plugin: Added missing support for BigInt(int8) postgres datatypes (r1250) (#384)

- OGR Plugin: Added support for reading multipoint features (#458)

- Shape Plugin: Fixed bug in file extension stripping (#413)

- Shape Plugin: Fixed missing compiler flags that causes crashing on newer g++ versions (#436)

- PNG: Fixed problem with garbled/striped png256 output along sharp edges(#416,#445,#447,#202)

- PNG: Added support for semi-transparency in png256 output (#477,#202)

- PolygonSymbolizer: Added 'gamma' attribute to allow for dilation of polygon edges - a solution
  to gap artifacts or "ghost lines" between adjacent polygons and allows for slight sharpening of
  the edges of non overlapping polygons. Accepts any values but 0-1 is the recommended range.

- TextSymbolizer: Large set of new attributes: 'text_transform', 'line_spacing', 'character_spacing',
  'wrap_character', 'wrap_before', 'horizontal_alignment', 'justify_alignment', and 'opacity'.

    * More details at changesets: r1254 and r1341

- SheildSymbolizer: Added special new attributes: 'unlock_image', 'VERTEX' placement, 'no_text' and many
  attributes previously only supported in the TextSymbolizer: 'allow_overlap', 'vertical_alignment',
  'horizontal_alignment', 'justify_alignment', 'wrap_width', 'wrap_character', 'wrap_before', 'text_transform',
  'line_spacing', 'character_spacing', and 'opacity'.

    * More details at changeset r1341

- XML: Added support for using CDATA with libxml2 parser (r1364)

- XML: Fixed memory leak in libxml2 implementation (#473)

- XML: Added function to serialize map to string, called 'mapnik.save_map_to_string()' (#396)

- XML: Added parameter to <Map> called 'minimum_version' to allow for enforcing the minimum Mapnik version
  needed for XML features used in the mapfiles. Uses Major.Minor.Point syntax, for example
  <Map minimum_version="0.6.1"> would throw an error if the user is running Mapnik less than 0.6.1.

- Filters: Added support for '!=' as an alias to '<>' for not-equals filters (avoids &lt;&gt;) (r1326) (#427)

- SCons: Improved boost auto-detection (r1255,r1279)

- SCons: Fixed support for JOBS=N and FAST=True to enable faster compiling (r1440)

- SCons: Ensured that -h or --help will properly print help on custom Mapnik options before a user
  has been able to properly run 'configure'. (r1514)

- SCons: Added ability to link to custom icu library name using ICU_LIB_NAME (r1414)
