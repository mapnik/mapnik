 - WARNING: index files generated with this newer Mapnik are invalid for older versions of Mapnik.
 - Any `.index` files accompanying a `.shp` must now be regenerated otherwise
   it will be skipped. To avoid this problem you can delete the existing `.index` files, or ideally run `shapeindex` to recreate the `.index`. ([#3300](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/pull/3300))
   The trigger for this change was an optimization that required a new binary format for the shapefile indexes ([#3217](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/pull/3217)).

 - Added `-fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden` to default compiler flags
 - Fixed parsing of SVG `PathElement` ([#3225](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/3225))
 - JSON parsing now supports arbitrary (nested) attributes in `geometry`
 - Support for rendering `dash-array` in SVGs
 - SVG parser is now stricter (fails is all input is not parsable) ([#3251](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/3251))
 - SVG parser now correctly handles optional separator `(,)` between multiple command parts
 - Optimized parsing of `png` format string
 - The `memory_datasource` now dynamically reports correct datasource type (vector or raster)

## 3.0.0

Released: July 7th, 2015

(Packaged from [e6891a0](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/commit/e6891a0))

#### Summary

The 3.0 release is a major milestone for Mapnik and includes many performance and design improvements. The is the first release to provide text shaping using the harfbuzz library. This harfbuzz support unlocks improved rendering and layer for many new languages, particularly SE Asian scripts. The internal storage for working with images and geometries has been made more flexible, faster, and strongly typed. The python bindings that were previously bundled with Mapnik have now been moved to <https://github.com/mapnik/python-mapnik> and are versioned independently.

#### Notice

 - Mapnik 3.0.0 requires a compiler capable of `std=c++11`.
 - It is highly recommended you use the `clang++` compiler on both OS X and Linux since it has robust c++11 support lower memory requirements.

##### Major Changes

- Improved support for International Text (now uses harfbuzz library for text shaping)

- Uses latest C++11 features for better performance (especially map loading)

- Expressions everywhere: all symbolizer properties can now be data driven expressions (with the exception of `face-name` and `fontset-name` on the `TextSymbolizer`).

- Rewritten geometry storage based on `std::vector` ([#2739](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2739))
  - Separate storage of polygon exterior rings and interior rings to allow for more robust clipping of parts.
  - Enforces consistent winding order per OGC spec (exterior rings are CCW, interior CW)
  - Reduced memory consumption for layers with many points
  - Ability to adapt Mapnik geometries to boost::geometry operations (in a zero-copy way)
  - Ability to have i/o grammars for json/wkt work on geometries rather than paths for better efficiency and simpler code

- Added new and experimental `dot` symbolizer for fast rendering of points

Also `clip` is now respected when rendering markers on a LineString
geometry.

- `TextSymbolizer` now supports `smooth`, `simplify`, `halo-opacity`, `halo-comp-op`, and `halo-transform`

- `ShieldSymbolizer` now supports `smooth`, `simplify`, `halo-opacity`, `halo-comp-op`, and `halo-transform`

- New GroupSymbolizer for applying multiple symbolizers in a single layout

- AGG renderer: fixed geometry offsetting to work after smoothing to produce more consistent results ([#2202](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2202))

- AGG renderer: increased `vertex_dist_epsilon` to ensure nearly coincident points are discarded more readily ([#2196](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2196))

- GDAL plugin
  - Now keeps datasets open for the lifetime of the datasource (rather than per featureset)
  - Added back support for user driven `nodata` on rgb(a) images ([#2023](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2023))
  - Allowed nodata to override alpha band if set on rgba images ([#2023](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/2023))

- Added Map level `background-image-comp-op` to control the compositing operation used to blend the
`background-image` onto the `background-color`. Has no meaning if `background-color` or `background-image`
are not set. ([#1966](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1966))

- Added `webp` image encoding and decoding support ([#1955](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1955))

- Added `scale-hsla` image-filter that allows scaling colors in HSL color space. RGB is converted to HSL (hue-saturation-lightness) and then each value (and the original alpha value) is stretched based on the specified scaling values. An example syntax is `scale-hsla(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)` which means no change because the full range will be kept (0 for lowest, 1 for highest). Other examples are: 1) `scale-hsla(0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1)` which would force all colors to be red in hue in the same way `scale-hsla(1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)` would, 2) `scale-hsla(0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1)` which would cause all colors to become fully saturated, 3) `scale-hsla(0,1,1,1,0,1,.5,1)` which would force no colors to be any more transparent than half, and 4) `scale-hsla(0,1,1,1,0,1,0,.5)` which would force all colors to be at least half transparent. ([#1954](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1954))

- The `shapeindex` tool now works correctly with point 3d geometry types


## 2.2.0

Released June 3rd, 2013

(Packaged from [9231205](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/commit/9231205))

Summary: The 2.2.0 release is primarily a performance and stability release. The code line represents development in the master branch since the release of 2.1.0 in Aug 2012 and therefore includes nearly a year of bug-fixes and optimizations. Nearly 500 new tests have been added bring the total coverage to 925. Shapefile and PostGIS datasources have benefited from numerous stability fixes, 64 bit integer support has been added to support OSM data in the grid renderer and in attribute filtering, and many fixes have landed for higher quality output when using a custom `scale_factor` during rendering. Critical code paths have been optimized include raster rendering, xml map loading, string to number conversion, vector reprojection when using `epsg:4326` and `epsg:3857`, `hextree` encoding, halo rendering, and rendering when using a custom `gamma`. Mapnik 2.2 also compiles faster than previous releases in the 2.x series and drops several unneeded and hard to install dependencies making builds on OS X and Windows easier than any previous release.

- Removed 3 dependencies without loosing any functionality: `ltdl`, `cairomm` and `libsigc++` ([#1804](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1804),[#806](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/806),[#1681](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1681))

- Added 64 bit integer support in expressions, feature ids, and the grid_renderer ([#1661](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1661),[#1662](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1662),[#1662](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1662))

- Added the ability to disable the need for various dependencies: `proj4`, `libpng`, `libtiff`, `libjpeg`

- Added faster reprojection support between `epsg:3857` and `epsg:4326` ([#1705](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1705),[#1703](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1703),[#1579](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1579))

- Added `colorize-alpha` image filter that applies user provided color gradients based on level of alpha.
  Accepts one or more colors separated by commas. Each color can be paired with an `offset` value separated
  by a space that is either `0-100%` or `0.0-1.0`. An `offset` of `0` is implied and the default. For background
  on where this design came from see http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#GradientStops. A simple example
  of colorizing alpha into a "rainbow" is `colorize-alpha(blue,cyan,lightgreen, yellow, orange, red)`. An example of
  using offsets and the variety of supported color encodings is to produce a ramp which sharp contrast between `blue`
  and `cyan` is `colorize-alpha(blue 30%, cyan, yellow 0.7 , rgb(0%,80%,0%) 90%)` ([#1371](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1371)).

- Fixed potential crash in wkb parsing when postgis returns null geometry ([#1843](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1843))

- Fixed blurry rendering of image and SVG icons ([#1316](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1316))

- Added `text-halo-rasterizer` property. Set to `fast` for lower quality but faster
  halo rendering ([#1298](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1298)) which matched new default method when radius is < 1.

- Added support in `shape`, `sqlite`, `geojson`, and `csv` plugin for handling non-latin characters in the paths to file-based resources ([#1177](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1177))

- Optimized rendering when a style with no symbolizers is encountered ([#1517](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1517))

- Optimized string handling and type conversion by removing `boost::to_lower`, `boost::trim`, and `boost::lexical_cast` usage ([#1687](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1687),[#1687](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1687),[#1633](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/1633))

- Added Layer `buffer-size` that can be used to override Map `buffer-size` to avoid
  over-fetching of data that does not need to be buffered as much as other layers.
  Map level `buffer-size` will be default if layers do not set the option. Renamed a

- Directly link input plugins to libmapnik to avoid having to set dlopen flags from binding languages ([#790](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/790))

- Throw an error during registration for fonts which Freetype2 does not report a family or style name (r2985).

- Fixed quoting syntax for "table"."attribute" in PostGIS plugin (previously if table aliases were used quoting like "table.attribute" would cause query failure) (r2979).

- Added the ability to control the PostGIS feature id by suppling a key_field to reference and integer attribute name (r2979).

- Added alternative, more robust proj_transform functions to project a bbox using more points than just the four
  corners to ensure an optimally sized bbox despite proj4 out of bounds conditions. (olt)

- Added map.base parameter that can be set to control where files with relative paths should be interpreted
  from when a map is loaded from a string or saved to a string. It defaults to an empty string which means
  that the base path will be the current working directory of the mapnik process. When a stylesheet is read
  from a file that files directory is used. And a custom value can still be passed as an argument to
  load_map_from_string().

- Added python function `render_grid` to allow conversion of grid buffer to python object containing list of grid
  pixels, list of keys, and a and dictionary of feature attributes.

- Added new rendering backend, grid_renderer, that collects the attributes of rendered features and
  burns their ids into a grid buffer.

- Added optional `maximum-extent` parameter to map object. If set will be used, instead of combined
  layer extents, for return value of map.zoom_all(). Useful in cases where the combined layer extents
  cannot possibly be projected into the map srs or the user wishes to control map bounds without
  modifying the extents of each layer.

- Support for `nodata` values with grey and rgb images in GDAL plugin ([#727](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/727))

# Mapnik 0.7.1

Released March 23, 2010

(Packaged from [db89f1c](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/commit/db89f1ca75) / r1745)

- Rasters: Various fixes and improvements to 8bit png output ([#522](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/522),[#475](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/475))

- XML: Save map buffer_size when serializing map.

- SCons: Added new build options `PRIORITIZE_LINKING` and `LINK_PRIORITY`. The first is a boolean (default True)
  of whether to use the new sorting implementation that gives explcit preference to custom or local paths
  during compile and linking that will affect builds when duplicate libraries and include directories are on the
  system. LINK_PRIORITY defaults to prioritizing internal sources of the mapnik source folder, then local/user
  installed libraries over system libraries, but the option can be customized. Sorting not only ensures that
  compiling and linking will more likely match the desired libraries but also gives more likelyhood to avoid
  the scenario where libraries are linked that don't match the includes libmapnik compiled against.

- XML: Fixed behavior of PolygonPatternSymbolizer and LinePatternSymbolizer whereby width, height,
  and type of images is actually allowed to be optionally ommitted ([#508](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/508)). This was added in r1543 but
  only worked correctly for PointSymbolizer and ShieldSymbolizer.

- Fixed reading of PostGIS data on Big Endian systems ([#515](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/515))

- PostGIS: Added better support for alterative schemas ([#500](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/500))

- AGG Renderer - Enforced default gamma function on all symbolizers to ensure proper antialiasing
  even when gamma is modified on the PolygonSymbolizer. ([#512](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/512))

- PNG: fixed png256 for large images and some improvements to reduce color corruptions ([#522](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/522))

- PNG: Added new quantization method for indexed png format using `hextree` with full support for alpha
  channel. Also new method has some optimizations for color gradients common when using elevation based
  rasters. By default old method using `octree` is used. (r1680, r1683, [#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477))

- PNG: Added initial support for passing options to png writter like number of colors, transparency
  support, quantization method and possibly other in future using type parameter. For example
  "png8:c=128:t=1:m=h" limits palette to 128 colors, uses only binary transparency (0 - none,
  1 - binary, 2 - full), and new method of quantization using `hextree` (h - `hextree`, o - `octree`).
  Existing type "png256" can be also written using "png8:c=256:m=o:t=2"  (r1680, r1683, [#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477))


# Mapnik 0.7.0

Released January, 19 2010

(Packaged from [a0da946](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/commit/a0da946be9) / r1574)

- Core: Fixed linking to external libagg (r1297,r1299)

- Core: Completed full support for PPC (Big endian) architectures (r1352 -> r1357)

- Gdal Plugin: Added support for Gdal overviews, enabling fast loading of > 1GB rasters ([#54](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/54))

    * Use the gdaladdo utility to add overviews to existing GDAL datasets

- PostGIS: Added an optional `geometry_table` parameter. The `geometry_table` used by Mapnik to look up
  metadata in the geometry_columns and calculate extents (when the `geometry_field` and `srid` parameters
  are not supplied). If `geometry_table` is not specified Mapnik will attempt to determine the name of the
  table to query based on parsing the `table` parameter, which may fail for complex queries with more than
  one `from` keyword. Using this parameter should allow for existing metadata and table indexes to be used
  while opening the door to much more complicated subqueries being passed to the `table` parameter without
  failing ([#260](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/260), [#426](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/426)).

- PostGIS Plugin: Added optional `geometry_field` and `srid` parameters. If specified these will allow
  Mapnik to skip several queries to try to determine these values dynamically, and can be helpful to avoid
  possible query failures during metadata lookup with complex subqueries as discussed in [#260](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/260) and [#436](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/436), but
  also solvable by specifying the `geometry_table` parameter. (r1300,[#376](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/376))

- PostGIS: Added an optional `extent_from_subquery` parameter that when true (while the `extent` parameter is
  not provided and `estimate_extent` is false) will direct Mapnik to calculate the extent upon the exact table
  or sql provided in the `table` parameter. If a sub-select is used for the table parameter then this will,
  in cases where the subquery limits results, provide a faster and more accurate layer extent. It will have
  no effect if the `table` parameter is simply an existing table. This parameter is false by default. ([#456](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/456))

- PostGIS Plugin: Added `!bbox!` token substitution ability in sql query string. This opens the door for various
  complex queries that may aggregate geometries to be kept fast by allowing proper placement of the bbox
  query to be used by indexes. ([#415](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/415))

    * Pass the bbox token inside a subquery like: !bbox!

    * Valid Usages include:
      ```sql
        <Parameter name="table">
          (Select ST_Union(geom) as geom from table where ST_Intersects(geometry,!bbox!)) as map
        </Parameter>

        <Parameter name="table">
          (Select * from table where geom && !bbox!) as map
        </Parameter>
      ```

- PostGIS Plugin: Added `scale_denominator` substitution ability in sql query string ([#415](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/415)/[#465](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/465))

    * Pass the scale_denominator token inside a subquery like: !scale_denominator!

    * e.g. (Select * from table where field_value > !scale_denominator!) as map

- PostGIS Plugin: Added support for quoted table names (r1454) ([#393](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/393))

- PostGIS: Add a `persist_connection` option (default true), that when false will release
  the idle psql connection after datasource goes out of scope (r1337) ([#433](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/433),[#434](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/434))

- PostGIS: Added support for BigInt (int8) postgres type (384)

- PNG: Added support for semi-transparency in png256 output ([#477](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/477),[#202](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/202))

- PolygonSymbolizer: Added `gamma` attribute to allow for dilation of polygon edges - a solution
  to gap artifacts or "ghost lines" between adjacent polygons and allows for slight sharpening of
  the edges of non overlapping polygons. Accepts any values but 0-1 is the recommended range.

- TextSymbolizer: Large set of new attributes: `text_transform`, `line_spacing`, `character_spacing`,
  `wrap_character`, `wrap_before`, `horizontal_alignment`, `justify_alignment`, and `opacity`.

    * More details at changesets: r1254 and r1341

- SheildSymbolizer: Added special new attributes: `unlock_image`, `VERTEX` placement, `no_text` and many
  attributes previously only supported in the TextSymbolizer: `allow_overlap`, `vertical_alignment`,
  `horizontal_alignment`, `justify_alignment`, `wrap_width`, `wrap_character`, `wrap_before`, `text_transform`,
  `line_spacing`, `character_spacing`, and `opacity`.
