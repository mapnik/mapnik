Mapnik 0.7.1 Release
--------------------

(Packaged from r1745)

- Rasters: Various fixes and improvements to 8bit png output (#522,#475)

- XML: Save map buffer_size when serializing map.

- SCons: Added new build options 'PRIORITIZE_LINKING' and 'LINK_PRIORITY'. The first is a boolean (default True)
  of whether to use the new sorting implementation that gives explcit preference to custom or local paths
  during compile and linking that will affect builds when duplicate libraries and include directories are on the
  system. LINK_PRIORITY defaults to prioritizing internal sources of the mapnik source folder, then local/user 
  installed libraries over system libraries, but the option can be customized. Sorting not only ensures that 
  compiling and linking will more likely match the desired libraries but also gives more likelyhood to avoid 
  the scenario where libraries are linked that don't match the includes libmapnik compiled against.

- XML: Fixed behavior of PolygonPatternSymbolizer and LinePatternSymbolizer whereby width, height,
  and type of images is actually allowed to be optionally ommitted (#508). This was added in r1543 but
  only worked correctly for PointSymbolizer and ShieldSymbolizer. 

- Fixed reading of PostGIS data on Big Endian systems (#515)

- PostGIS: Added better support for alterative schemas (#500)

- AGG Renderer - Enforced default gamma function on all symbolizers to ensure proper antialiasing
  even when gamma is modified on the PolygonSymbolizer. (#512)

- PNG: fixed png256 for large images and some improvements to reduce color corruptions (#522)

- PNG: Added new quantization method for indexed png format using hextree with full support for alpha
  channel. Also new method has some optimizations for color gradients common when using elevation based
  rasters. By default old method using octree is used. (r1680, r1683, #477)

- PNG: Added initial support for passing options to png writter like number of colors, transparency
  support, quantization method and possibly other in future using type parameter. For example
  "png8:c=128:t=1:m=h" limits palette to 128 colors, uses only binary transparency (0 - none,
  1 - binary, 2 - full), and new method of quantization using hextree (h - hextree, o - octree).
  Existing type "png256" can be also written using "png8:c=256:m=o:t=2"  (r1680, r1683, #477)

Mapnik 0.7.0 Release
--------------------

(Packaged from r1574)

- Core: Fixed linking to external libagg (r1297,r1299)

- Core: Completed full support for PPC (Big endian) architectures (r1352 -> r1357)

- Gdal Plugin: Added support for Gdal overviews, enabling fast loading of > 1GB rasters (#54)

    * Use the gdaladdo utility to add overviews to existing GDAL datasets

- PostGIS: Added an optional 'geometry_table' parameter. The 'geometry_table' used by Mapnik to look up 
  metadata in the geometry_columns and calculate extents (when the 'geometry_field' and 'srid' parameters
  are not supplied). If 'geometry_table' is not specified Mapnik will attempt to determine the name of the 
  table to query based on parsing the 'table' parameter, which may fail for complex queries with more than
  one 'from' keyword. Using this parameter should allow for existing metadata and table indexes to be used
  while opening the door to much more complicated subqueries being passed to the 'table' parameter without
  failing (#260, #426).

- PostGIS Plugin: Added optional 'geometry_field' and 'srid' parameters. If specified these will allow
  Mapnik to skip several queries to try to determine these values dynamically, and can be helpful to avoid
  possible query failures during metadata lookup with complex subqueries as discussed in #260 and #436, but
  also solvable by specifying the 'geometry_table' parameter. (r1300,#376)

- PostGIS: Added an optional 'extent_from_subquery' parameter that when true (while the 'extent' parameter is
  not provided and 'estimate_extent' is false) will direct Mapnik to calculate the extent upon the exact table
  or sql provided in the 'table' parameter. If a sub-select is used for the table parameter then this will,
  in cases where the subquery limits results, provide a faster and more accurate layer extent. It will have
  no effect if the 'table' parameter is simply an existing table. This parameter is false by default. (#456)

- PostGIS Plugin: Added 'bbox' token substitution ability in sql query string. This opens the door for various
  complex queries that may aggregate geometries to be kept fast by allowing proper placement of the bbox
  query to be used by indexes. (#415)

    * Pass the bbox token inside a subquery like: !bbox!

    * e.g. (Select ST_Union(geom) as geom from table where ST_Intersects(geometry,!bbox!)) as map

- PostGIS Plugin: Added 'scale_denominator' substitution ability in sql query string (#415/#465)

    * Pass the scale_denominator token inside a subquery like: !scale_denominator!

    * e.g. (Select * from table where field_value > !scale_denominator!) as map

- PostGIS Plugin: Added support for quoted table names (r1454) (#393)

- PostGIS: Add a 'persist_connection' option (default true), that when false will release 
  the idle psql connection after datasource goes out of scope (r1337) (#433,#434)

- PostGIS: Added support for BigInt (int8) postgres type (384)

- PostGIS Plugin: Throw and report errors if SQL execution fails (r1291) (#363, #242)

- PostGIS Plugin: Fixed problem in conversion of long numbers to strings (r1302,1303)

- PostGIS Plugin: Added missing support for BigInt(int8) postgres datatypes (r1250) (#384)

- OGR Plugin: Added support for reading multipoint features (#458)

- Shape Plugin: Fixed bug in file extension stripping (#413)

- Shape Plugin: Fixed missing compiler flags that causes crashing on newer g++ versions (#436)

- PNG: Fixed problem with garbled/striped png256 output along sharpe edges(#416,#445,#447,#202)

- PNG: Added support for semitransparency in png256 output (#477,#202)

- PolygonSymbolizer: Added 'gamma' attribute to allow for dilation of polygon edges - a solution
  to gap artifacts or "ghost lines" between adjacent polygons and allows for slight sharpening of
  the edges of non overlapping polygons. Accepts any values but 0-1 is the recommended range.
   
- TextSymbolizer: Large set of new attributes: 'text_convert', 'line_spacing', 'character_spacing', 
  'wrap_character', 'wrap_before', 'horizontal_alignment', 'justify_alignment', and 'opacity'.

    * More details at changesets: r1254 and r1341

- SheildSymbolizer: Added special new attributes: 'unlock_image', 'VERTEX' placement, 'no_text' and many
  attributes previously only supported in the TextSymbolizer: 'allow_overlap', 'vertical_alignment', 
  'horizontal_alignment', 'justify_alignment', 'wrap_width', 'wrap_character', 'wrap_before', 'text_convert',
  'line_spacing', 'character_spacing', and 'opacity'.

    * More details at changeset r1341

- XML: Added support for using CDATA with libxml2 parser (r1364)

- XML: Fixed memory leak in libxml2 implementation (#473)

- XML: Added function to serialize map to string, called 'mapnik.save_map_to_string()' (#396)

- XML: Added parameter to <Map> called 'minimum_version' to allow for enforcing the minimum Mapnik version
  needed for XML features used in the mapfiles. Uses Major.Minor.Point syntax, for example
  <Map minimum_version="0.6.1"> would throw an error if the user is running Mapnik less than 0.6.1.
